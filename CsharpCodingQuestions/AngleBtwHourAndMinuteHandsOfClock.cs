         * 
         * input: 9 30, output: The angle between hour hand and minute hand is 105 degrees
         * input: 13 30, output: The angle between hour hand and minute hand is 135 degrees
         * 
         * The logic is to find the difference in the angle of an hour and minute hand from the position of 12 O Clock when 
         * the angle between them is zero. Each hour on the clock represents an angle of 30 degrees (360 divided by 12). 
         * Similarly, each minute on the clock will represent an angle of 6 degrees (360 divided by 60) and the angle for an hour 
         * will increase as the minutes for that hour increases.
